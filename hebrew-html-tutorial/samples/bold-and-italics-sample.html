<i>Alice</i> was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister
on the bank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped
into the book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or
conversations in it, "and what is the use of a book," thought Alice, 
"without <b>pictures</b> or <b>conversation?</b>"
