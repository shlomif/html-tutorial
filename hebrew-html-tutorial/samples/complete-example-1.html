    <h1>Excerpt from the Three Musketeers</h1>
    
    <p>
A young man--we can sketch his portrait at a dash. Imagine
to yourself a Don Quixote of eighteen; a Don Quixote without
his corselet, without his coat of mail, without his cuisses;
a Don Quixote clothed in a woolen doublet, the blue color of
which had faded into a nameless shade between lees of wine
and a heavenly azure; face long and brown; high cheek bones,
a sign of sagacity; the maxillary muscles enormously
developed, an infallible sign by which a Gascon may always
be detected, even without his cap--and our young man wore a
cap set off with a sort of feather; the eye open and
intelligent; the nose hooked, but finely chiseled. Too big
for a youth, too small for a grown man, an experienced eye
might have taken him for a farmer's son upon a journey had
it not been for the long sword which, dangling from a
leather baldric, hit against the calves of its owner as he
walked, and against the rough side of his steed when he was
on horseback.
